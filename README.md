# Text Field with Placeholder
---
The next is a simple class extending `JTextField` that can display a placeholder.  

I made the placeholder to be aligned to the center vertically because of
usage purposes (maybe I make the text field to define the alignment of its placeholder in the future),
and also, I couldn't find info about how does the original `JTextField`
align text to the center vertically, so I hope I can help someone with the same doubt as me.
